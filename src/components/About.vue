    <h4>
      The service utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform image
      classification.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      The frontend is created with Vue.js, which communicates with a Flask Application
      Interface (API) which handles interacting with the CNN
      and serves some of the information the frontend displays.

    <h4>
      As it stands, there is no recourse or prevention information available, but
      the system is in place to serve it dynamically when the information is obtained.
